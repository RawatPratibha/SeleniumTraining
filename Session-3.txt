Robot Class

Hands On-
Visit the Browserstack home page- 
https://www.browserstack.com/   and click and hold on the get started free button. Apply robot class for the operations.


ROBOT CLASS
The Robot class in Selenium is not actually a part of Selenium itself, but it’s a Java AWT class that’s often used alongside Selenium to handle tasks that Selenium alone can’t do — especially things like keyboard/mouse actions outside the browser.
  It comes from java.awt.Robot package (part of Java's standard library)
  It can simulate real keyboard and mouse events
 It's useful for interacting with OS-level dialogs, like file uploads, alerts, etc.

Why ROBOT class with Selenium-
Selenium can only interact with HTML elements in the browser. But sometimes you need to:
•	Upload a file using a native file dialog
•	Simulate keyboard keys like Enter, Tab, Ctrl+C
•	Move or click the mouse outside the browser

When to use Robot vs Actions class?
Feature	                                             Robot Class	                                                Actions Class
Works outside browser?	            Yes	                                                    No
Works inside browser?                  	               Yes (limited)	                                     Yes
Simulates real OS-level events?	  Yes	                                                   No
Best for                                                  File uploads, OS popups                       Drag & drop, hover, 
double-click
